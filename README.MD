# Password/Text Entropy Calculator
After watching a Computerphile video on passwords and talking with some of my friends and us trying to calculate our entropies by hand, I decided to make a program to do it for us. 

I know there are plenty online tools (which I don't trust, cause don't want my password to be stolen) and similar tools inside other security suites, but I wanted to get some practice in so why not?
